## AHM code

# TO DO list

## Additional material needed for AHM2

At many points in the book it says that full code or additional code is available on the website. Most of that has been inserted into the scripts for the relevant (sub)section. Code to produce most of the plots has also been added.

The following are still outstanding:

### AHM2 chapter 1
* 1.7.2 (Swiss tits data) "We have the code for all 8 models on the website and only show [10d and 11] here".
* Figures 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.13 (the last used output for models 10a-c).

### AHM2 chapter 2
* 2.4.3 Code for the analysis for each of the 10-min samples (occasions).
* Figure 2.10

### AHM2 chapter 3
* 3.3.1  "We do this by browsing...(see webside for code)."

### AHM2 chapter 4
* 4.7 Book text says "You will find all the code on the website", but not clear what is referred to.
* 4.8.2 "The code...is shown on the website only."
* 4.11 (peregrines) Model 4 is missing.
* Figure 4.19 (range size of crossbills) missing.

### AHM2 chapter 5
* 5.7 (Norwegian birds) "We pull out all sites from a region...(see website for full code)."

### AHM2 chapter 6
(all good)

## Other things to fix

* Calls to `par` should be followed by code to reset the old pars.
* Add times for code execution to all scripts.
