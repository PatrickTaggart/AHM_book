## AHM code

# TO DO list

## Additional material needed for AHM2

At many points in the book it says that full code or additional code is available on the website. Most of that has been inserted into the scripts for the relevant (sub)section. Code to produce most of the plots has also been added.

The following are still outstanding:

### AHM2 chapter 1
* Figures 1.8, 1.9, 1.10 - based on simulations.

### AHM2 chapter 2
* 2.4.3 Code for the analysis for each of the 10-min samples (occasions).
* Figure 2.10

### AHM2 chapter 5
* Figure 5.11 (cosinor plot, and the code to produce the variables plotted).

### AHM2 chapter 7
* 7.6.6 "We conducted a small simulation study to evaluate the influence of the coupled occupancy model on classification (see the book website for code)."
* Figures 7.3, 7.5.

### AHM2 chapter 11
* Figures 11.13, 11.14, 11.15, 11.17.
