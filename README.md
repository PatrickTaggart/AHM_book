# AHM code

The book *Applied Hierarchical Modeling in Ecology: Analysis of distribution, abundance and species richness in R and BUGS* by Marc KÃ©ry and Andy Royle contains lots of R and BUGS code. The code for the first volume, with some updates, is available as a single huge text file on the [book web page](http://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/pubanalysis/keryroylebook/).

Volume 2 will shortly appear with more code, and the plan is to make available additional code not included in the book.

I'm suggesting that the code be provided in a Github repository, which has some advantages:

* Ease of updating code for individual book sections to cope with changes in R, JAGS and packages.
* Update history is displayed on the Github web page, easy to check for recent changes.
* Users can download individual files, or a zip file with everything using the "Clone or Download" button.
* The Issues section can be used to discuss changes needed.
* Users can make pull requests with modified code.

Note that I'm *not* suggesting that this should be an R package. Package compilation strips out comments in the code.
